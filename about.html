          <h1>A little bit about me...</h1> 

          <p>(Try to blend the photo into the background using box-shadow css.) Here I will talk about where I have come from, what I have previously done career wise,</p> 
          
          <p>what I am currently doing and where my current interests lie.</p> 
          
          <p>Its very exciting to be learning in the tech space and to be empowered by other women who are on their own learning discoveries.</p>
          
          <p>I look forward to the future, I think there is true hope in knowledge.   maybe some other words and stuff idk!</p>
