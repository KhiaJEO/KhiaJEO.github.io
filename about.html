            <p>Hey, I'm Khia and I'm currently participating in the She Codes Plus Program! 
            <p>I'm a GIS Analyst (Geographic Information Systems) intern at Winyama, a Digital Solutions Organisation empowering Indigenous mob in the tech space. I'm reasonably new to the job, and my role includes visualising data for rangers who work out on Country.
            As someone who is new to the role and an Intern, I'm learning the ropes of mapping software, Earth Observations, data capturing technology and Native Title.</p> 
            <p>Its very exciting to be learning in the tech space and to be encouraged by other women who are on their own learning discoveries.</p>
            <p>At She Codes, we are learning how to code. The languages we are learning include:</p>
          </div>

          <div class="profile-content-list"
            <p>Python</p>
            <p>HTML CSS & Javascript</p>
            <p>Django</p>
            <p>& React</p>

          </div>

          <p>As I progress through the She Codes Program, I will update this website to include other projects that have been completed.</p>
          
          <p>Prior to being accepted into the She Codes program I had NO previous coding experience. I mean, I've seen people code before, 
            I've tried to read it to solve a problem in ArcGIS Pro (mapping software) but none of it made sense to me and I had no idea what I was doing. 
            Since joining this Plus Program cohort, I have complete 1 Python Assignment called Project Weather.</p>
          
          <p>Up until now I have complete two projects with She Codes:</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/SheCodesAus/she-codes-python-weather-project-KhiaJEO.git"> Check out my projects on GitHub HERE!</a> 
            <p>There are more projects to come, so stay tuned!</p>
